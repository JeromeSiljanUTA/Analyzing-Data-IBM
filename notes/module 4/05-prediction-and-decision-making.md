# Prediction and Decision Making

 - R squared and mean squared are good ways to approximate accuracy of prediction
 - They're not perfect because sometimes quadratic approximations will fit linear better (according to r squared and MSE)
 - 0.60 r squared value means 60% of the changes in data are due to the independent variable
